# Hate Speech Detection App

Welcome! This is a simple yet powerful web app that uses machine learning to detect hate or offensive language in text.

## What It Does

Type a sentence like **"I hate you"**, and the app will instantly predict whether it’s **offensive** or **not**.  
It's designed to demonstrate how machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) can identify hate speech in online conversations, such as on social media or comment sections.

## 🧩 How It Works

1. A dataset with labeled text (hate, offensive, or clean speech) is used.
2. Text is cleaned and preprocessed using NLP techniques.
3. A machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression) is trained on this data.
4. The trained model is saved as `model.pkl`.
5. A **Streamlit** web app allows users to input text and get real-time predictions from the model.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `dataset.csv` — Raw data used for training the model  
- `train_model.py` — Preprocessing + Model training script  
- `model.pkl` — Saved trained ML model  
- `app.py` — Streamlit web app interface  
- `README.md` — You're reading it 😉


## 💬 Try Saying...

- ✅ "that cool" → Not Offensive  
- ❌ "I hate it" → Offensive


## 📌 Why This Project Exists

This project was created as a practical exploration of machine learning and natural language processing.  
Online hate speech is a significant concern, and this app demonstrates how AI can assist in detecting and mitigating such language.


## ☁️ Hosting It

You can deploy this app easily on platforms like:

- [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud)
- [Render](https://render.com/)
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Expand training to larger and multilingual datasets  
- Integrate advanced models such as BERT or transformer architectures  
- Implement a user feedback system to enhance model accuracy  
- Develop a browser extension powered by this model
